# Explainable AI Loan Approval Simulator

## Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning system that predicts whether a loan
application will be approved and explains the decision using Explainable AI.

Unlike traditional black-box models, this system shows:
- Why the prediction happened
- Which features influenced it
- How the applicant can improve approval chances

## Key Features
1. Loan approval prediction using ML
2. Explainability using SHAP
3. What-if simulation for financial changes
4. Interactive Streamlit dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP (Explainable AI)
- Pandas / NumPy
- Streamlit (UI)

## Goal
Create a transparent AI decision-support tool for financial analysis.
